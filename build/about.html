Point syntax is similar to CSS's syntax and is capable of seamlessly intergrating into your existing web framework or being used standalone. The transpiler is written in C# and is flexible, lightweight and efficent.</p></div><div class="card"><h2>This entire website was transpiled from/by Point</h2><p>Yes, all the HTML pages on this site were generated by Point, the source code for this site (point lang) is available on <a href="https://github.com/Melodi17/Point-Web" class="link">GitHub</a>.</p></div><div class="card"><h2>Why use Point?</h2><p>As we advance into the future, we need more powerful tools to perform more complex tasks, even faster than before. Point is fast, simple and capable. For example, you can now use variables in your code, you can calculate expressions at runtime like this: 1037 * 5, you would have to open calculator and figure that out if you were using HTML, now you can just write that and it will be calculated for you. Let's say you wanted to make a div with a class spacer, in HTML it would be something like this: <strong>&ltdiv class='spacer'&gt&lt/div&gt</strong>, in Point you can just write: <strong>.spacer { }</strong> as it automatically assumes any element without a tag is a div.</p></div></td><td class="gutter"></td><td class="col"><div class="card"><h2>Point history</h2><p>Point was developed by Melodi17 (GitHub account) in 2021, it was initially developed as a project for convinence and to replace HTML (HyperText Markup Language) with a more powerful and flexible language.</p></div></td></tr></table></div><div class="footer"><p>Made by Melodi</p></div></body></html>
